This application has two important responsibilities. First, it serves the files in the ```public``` folder as the root of your application. Second, it provides the REST API that your application will use for data persistence.

## Getting started

### Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/anoopmundathan/spa.git
$ cd spa
```
### Install
```
$ npm install
```
### Build
```$ npm run db ``` to build the database

### Run
``` $ npm start ``` to run the Node.js application REST API.


To test your application, open your web browser and browse to ```http://localhost:5000/```. You should see your application’s “Home” or “Default” page, which is the index.html file located in the public folder.

To test the REST API, Open your web browser and browse to ```http://localhost:5000/api/recipes```. You should see a list of recipes displayed in JSON format.
